### Help Keep The Write On ###

Neuropsych Now is all about delivering high-quality, easily accessible content to neuropsychology students and clinicians. If you've visited a couple of our pages, then you probably have a sense of what we're talking about. 

We work hard to deliver as much original content as possible, but we're also counting on input from other neuropsychology clinicians and students. Contributions are, we believe, the key to growing into a resource unlike anything ever seen in the field of neuropsychology. So, we're accepting submissions for any information that you think others would benefit from (such as a link or original content). 

If you're interested in contributing an article, please first read our [Terms & Conditions page](terms.html). If you are comfortable with our terms and have something you'd like to submit, then please send us an email with your content included/attached. 

While we want people to get involved with Neuropsych Now, please understand that we can't/won't publish or link everything that comes our way. There are many different reasons for this, which are outlined on the [Terms & Conditions page](terms.html).

### Help Keep The Lights On ###

Neuropsych Now is a means to help enhance the practice of neuropsychology, and we hope that it continues to grow over time. If you like what you see, and/or have found value in any of our content and resources, please let us know by making a micro-donation of 9 cents to Neuropsych Now. That's just 9 pennies, but that amount keeps us running for a day (on average). These small donations will help to ensure the future of this site.

We presently pay for all costs ourselves, and will continue to do so as long as there is a demand. Please know that 100% of each donation is used to offset our operating costs, which are:

1. Site hosting bandwidth at [NearlyFreeSpeech.Net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) - this is where the Neuropsych Now Web site is hosted.
2. [Amazon web services](http://aws.amazon.com/) bandwidth - we use Amazon web services as our Content Distribution Network (or CDN) to efficiently serve up media of all types (e.g., images, video). 

No matter what, we sincerely thank everyone for their ongoing support of Neuropsych Now!
