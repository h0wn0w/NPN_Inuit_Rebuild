<p>Neuropsych Now is all about delivering high-quality, easily accessible content to neuropsychology students and clinicians. If you&#8217;ve visited a couple of our pages, then you probably have a sense of what we&#8217;re talking about. </p>

<p>We work hard to deliver as much original content as possible, but we&#8217;re also counting on input from other neuropsychology clinicians and students. Contributions are, we believe, the key to growing into a resource unlike anything ever seen in the field of neuropsychology. So, we&#8217;re accepting submissions for any information that you think others would benefit from (such as a link or original content). </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in contributing an article, please first read our <a href="terms.html">Terms &amp; Conditions page</a>. If you are comfortable with our terms and have something you&#8217;d like to submit, then please send us an email with your content included/attached. </p>

<p>While we want people to get involved with Neuropsych Now, please understand that we can&#8217;t/won&#8217;t publish or link everything that comes our way. There are many different reasons for this, which are outlined on the <a href="terms.html">Terms &amp; Conditions page</a>.</p>

<p>Neuropsych Now is a means to help enhance the practice of neuropsychology, and we hope that it continues to grow over time. If you like what you see, and/or have found value in any of our content and resources, please let us know by making a micro-donation of 9 cents to Neuropsych Now. That&#8217;s just 9 pennies, but that amount keeps us running for a day (on average). These small donations will help to ensure the future of this site.</p>

<p>We presently pay for all costs ourselves, and will continue to do so as long as there is a demand. Please know that 100% of each donation is used to offset our operating costs, which are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Site hosting bandwidth at <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech.Net</a> - this is where the Neuropsych Now Web site is hosted.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon web services</a> bandwidth - we use Amazon web services as our Content Distribution Network (or CDN) to efficiently serve up media of all types (e.g., images, video).</li>
</ol>

<p>No matter what, we sincerely thank everyone for their ongoing support of Neuropsych Now!</p>
