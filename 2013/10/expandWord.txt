Writing in plain text is, to us, largely superior to using a full-blown word processor. Plain text *files* are lightweight and versatile. Plain text *editors* are, relative to most word processors, free of questionably useful features, leaving a distraction-free writing environment. In one of our [previous screencasts](http://neuronow.com/2013/08/gettingreportsdone_2), we demonstrated some of the benefits of writing reports with [TextExpander for Mac](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html). 

In case it isn't clear, we think writing with plain text is great.[^1] Unfortunately, the sample size of neuropsychologists writing reports in plain text is probably n = 2. That means that the aforementioned screencast, while clearly *incredibly* fun to watch, may not have been that useful to you. 

This screencast is our attempt to make something that appeals to others - *any* others: we used Microsoft Word as the writing platform. Everyone uses Word, so it made sense to show how we use it, too. 

The expansion snippet shown here is *much* more advanced/complex than the one from the previous TextExpander screencast; it has evolved. While it took a lot of effort to get it working well in MS Word, it affords incredible flexibility. Ultimately, you need only this one snippet to replace all the templates in your arsenal. Writing a peds report or geriatric evaluation? It doesn't matter. This is cohort/referral question agnostic. At least the *method* is, if not the snippet. The snippet evolves with your needs. More on that in an as-yet-to-be-written article.

Everyone uses report templates throughout training and professional practice. Our goal with screencasts and articles like this one is to show that there are other ways of doing something that is central to our profession. We hope that these will help you out at some point along the way; [enjoy the show][1]!

[^1]: In fact, every article on this web site is written in plain text first. We then use the MultiMarkdown Content Management System (CMS) that drives most of this site to convert it into HTML. If you'd like to see what this (or any) article looks like before it gets rendered, just type `.txt` at the end of the article's URL and press enter/return on your keyboard. Presto! Plain text! Pretty cool, right?
