It will be essential in college to learn how to be a strategic reader. Never simply start to read an assignment. First, skim by reading the title, subtitles, graphs, introduction, and conclusion to get an overview of the reading selection or book. If reading a chapter in a book (not a textbook with heading, etc.), skim by reading the first paragraph, or two, then randomly select a topic sentence per page and read the final paragraph or two. After skimming, go to the lecture. Immediately after the lecture read the entire assignment. Later, take notes, write in the margins, or highlight in different colored markers for main idea and specific details. Go to the library or bookstore for Cliffs Notes or critiques of books. A good routine to follow for getting the most out of reading assignments is to skim the material before the class lecture on it, take notes during the lecture, review the notes after the lecture, thoroughly read the assigned material as soon as possible after the lecture, and take notes. If there is a class discussion on a reading assignment (rather than a lecture), then plan to have skimmed, read and made notes on the material before the discussion. It is helpful:

* to dictate initial thoughts into a tape recorder before writing papers (brainstorm). 
* to make outline listing the thesis and sub-topics before beginning to write.
* to make an outline listing the thesis and sub-topics before beginning to write.
* to list on one page for each paragraph the ideas, facts and information needed to make the point or argument to determine whether sufficient material have been collected.
* to construct a first draft on the computer.
* to proofread papers in three separate sessions: 1. review the content and sequencing of ideas by reading each paragraph and asking yourself: What is its purpose? and Why does it follow the previous paragraph? and How does it relate to the next?; 2. eliminate redundant sentences and shorten and simplify awkward or wordy sentences by reading awkward sentences aloud; 3. correct spelling and grammar errors using spell and grammar checks on the computer.It is usually helpful to tape important lectures (before tests) and to experiment with taking lecture notes on the computer. It is usually helpful to stay after classes to review lectures notes and add ideas that might not have been recorded adequately during the lecture.XXX can also benefit from an executive functioning mentor to assist in organization and planning, flexibility and memory skills. Such a person can help him/her develop different strategies and the use of different computerized or technical assistance such as a personal device assistant (PDA).XXX should receive a mentor/teacher support from within his/her school to assist him/her with organization and study strategies. His/Her mentor should assist him/her with writing strategies, writing main ideas, creating an outline, writing a first draft, and obtaining early feedback from his/her teacher and then incorporating that feedback into a paper.XXX should have the option of audiotaping lectures for review at a later time. The multi tasking action of taking notes and listening can be difficult for XXX. The teacher is requested to provide an outline or the power point copy of their lecture prior to the class to XXX. This action will allow XXX to review the notes and to take his/her own notes on top of the outline/power point. This intervention will increase memory and encoding skills.XXX should have access to textbooks and a tape for all of his/her textbooks. By reading and listening to text tapes/CDs, his/her reading comprehension will be increased significantly.On tests, XXX should receive extended time. On multiple-choice questions, he/she should have the option to read the questions out loud sub-vocally. Tests should be administered in low stimulus rooms or by him/herself in a room.  When studying for a test, XXX needs to be in a secluded, quiet environment. It is important for his/her teachers to provide a study guide to ensure that he/she is studying the correct material. When reading material, XXX may overlook an important or pertinent fact. It is important for him/her to know what the professor considers important to allow him/her to search for that information.XXX will benefit from a “word bank” during tests. This is a list of words without definitions that can “cue” his/her memory of factual data.  XXX’s restricted verbal memory required greater effort to concentrate; therefore, he/she requires additional rest breaks or testing over a two-day period.XXX would benefit from a vocational assessment and related skills training to help him/her identify a realistic career path that is of interest to him/her and develop the necessary skills required for success. XXX will likely have the most success in a field with a limited emphasis on verbal communication and interpersonal interactions, which utilizes his/her relative strengths for visual/nonverbal reasoning and working memory. For example, a mechanical or computer oriented focus would be more appropriate for him/her than a career in customer service.In the event that XXX returns to school for additional educational training, XXX would benefit from increased one-to-one tutoring to promote learning. Tutoring should focus on applications of rote skills, such as reading for comprehension and writing for expression of ideas (vs. rote word reading and spelling). Tutoring should also continue to foster the development of visual-spatial skills, as this appears to be an area of relative strength for XXX and may help him/her develop vocational aspirations.Tutoring is also recommended to provide repeated exposure to newly learned material for better encoding and recall. XXX demonstrated a significant, though slowed, learning curve during testing which strongly suggests that he/she is capable of learning both verbal and visual information consistent with his/her peers, although he/she requires repeated exposure and additional learning trials for adequate encoding of information into memory.XXX would also benefit from the following accommodations within the home, classroom, and/or work environments:•	Extended time for tests, assignments, and projects•	Provide separate performance evaluations for speed or completion and accuracy (do not penalize for slowed speed)•	Encourage him/her to check his/her work for accuracy•	Break task instructions down to one-step at a time and continually assess his/her comprehension.•	Pair visual-spatial tasks or instructions with verbal reasoning for them, and vice versa.•	Eliminate distractions from his/her workspace and environment (i.e., seating assignment close to the front of the room, but near a role model who is on-task; away from windows and doors). Encourage XXX to keep his/her workspace clutter-free, containing only the required materials.XXX qualifies for academic support services and accommodations under a 504 Plan. XXX will need to contact the Disability Resources and Services (DRS) center at the University of Pittsburgh to initiate this process. Please visit www.drs.pitt.edu for additional information. Specific accommodations should include the following:•	Decreased workload•	Extended time for tests, as needed.•	Exams to be taken on computer, whenever possible, or the ability to write on the exam booklet•	Use of a formula sheet for science or math exams•	Exams to be taken in a small environment, free of environmental distractions•	Study skills and organizational tutoring•	Tutoring for Chemistry, or other challenging courses, as needed •	Audio recordings and annotated notes of class lecturesXXX struggled considerably on tasks that required him/her to work both quickly and accurately, resulting in both slower performance speeds and decreased accuracy of responding. Because of this, XXX would benefit from extended time to complete tests and projects, and be encouraged to slow down and check his/her work for accuracy.  Additionally, where applicable, separate grades should be provided for speed and accuracy.XXX would benefit from additional structure within his/her learning environment. He/She is likely to struggle on tasks that require rote memorization, but excel when information to be memorized is provided within a meaningful, structured narrative. It is important to note, however, that XXX is likely to struggle to create and organized structure for him/herself, and will require more support than other individuals his/her age to accomplish this. Furthermore, XXX demonstrated difficulty with taking information out of this context, so additional tutoring, and instruction to apply learned information both in and out of context may be helpful.XXX would benefit from receiving a copy of the teacher’s lecture notes and/or PowerPoint presentations in advance to aid in note taking organization and reduced working memory demand, allowing him/her to more efficiently attend to the class lectures while filling in important details or examples provided in class.XXX may benefit from recording lectures for later review, to provide additional exposure to this information and to allow him/her to clarify his/her lecture notes as necessary. Likewise, XXX may benefit from the use of dictation software, such as Dragon, both at home and at school.XXX is likely to have difficulty with large projects or papers, due to reports that he/she tends to underestimate the time required to complete a task and his/her tendency to put assignments off until the last minute. Because of this, XXX would benefit from having large assignments broken down into smaller portions each with a specific due date. For example, for a class term paper, XXX should have a predetermined date when his/her topic is due, then another date for the outline, another date for the introduction of the paper, and so on to help teach him/her how to manage his/her time effectively on large projects. Check in with him/her to make sure that he/she is progressing according to schedule.XXX would benefit from being paired with an organized student for lab assignments, group projects, and/or presentations. It is recommended that large assignments be broken down into smaller steps and his/her responsibilities within the group be made clear to him/her early on, to avoid difficulties close to the deadlines.XXX would benefit from access to a tutor to assist him/her with challenging concepts, such as Chemistry, by providing repeated exposure and additional time to complete assignments.XXX may find it easier to type than to write his/her assignments and exams. It is recommended that he/she be allowed the use of a laptop or computer in class for this purpose, and that written assignments be accepted in typed rather than written format whenever possible.XXX’s workload should be comparable to his/her ability to demonstrate mastery of the skills in question. He/She would benefit from a reduced workload due to his/her slowed processing and increased likelihood of making errors when he/she has to work quickly.  XXX would benefit from organizational tutoring to address expressed difficulties in organizing and using study time effectively. Additionally, tutoring should work with XXX to develop mnemonic devices and other memory aids to help him/her retrieve learned information. XXX would also benefit from assistance in learning “chunking” techniques to organize information for better learning and memory.XXX would benefit from taking a course that specifically teaches test-taking strategies to help him/her learn how to best approach multiple-choice exams. A moderate amount of test anxiety may be interfering with his /her test performance. Such a course would likely improve his/her confidence and self-efficacy with test taking behaviors, in addition to improving his/her overall strategy.XXX may benefit from a study skills tutor to help him/her learn how to study more effectively, as it sounds as though his/her academic difficulties stem predominantly from low test scores. The following are some suggested study techniques which XXX might find helpful:* At the beginning of each semester, schedule a meeting with each of your instructors to find out how they recommend you most effectively study for their course and divide your study time accordingly (e.g. how much time should be spent reviewing lecture notes vs. reading the text).
* Two weeks before a test, ask your instructor for an outline of what topics will be covered on the test. Create a “study schedule” using this outline, and study a little bit (30 minutes) each night leading up to the test. Each night, before you begin to study a new section on the outline, spend 5-10 minutes reviewing the information studied on previous nights to keep the information fresh in your memory and allow you to better link new concepts with previously studied material.
* Create flash cards to quiz yourself on vocabulary terms or other information that requires rote memorization. Bring these flash cards with you everywhere you go and take them out whenever you find you have some free time (e.g. waiting for a class to start, while on the treadmill at the gym, waiting for the bus, etc.).
* When studying, try to avoid just re-reading the materials and notes, and start trying to anticipate the types of questions that might be asked on the exam. Write out short descriptions for yourself of how concepts relate to one another. If there are vocabulary terms that are similar or interrelated, be sure you understand how the concepts are related and how they are different, so that you can effectively chose the correct term on a multiple choice exam.•	On multiple-choice exams, you may find it helpful to read the question while covering up the answer choices. First, try to answer the question for yourself, and then look to see if your answer is one of the choices. If your answer is not there, then start by eliminating choices that you know are not correct and try to narrow it down from there. On multiple-multiple choice exams, cross out any answers that you know are not correct and work backwards from there.•	Ask your instructors if it is okay for you to write on your tests or exam booklets. (If not, they should be able to provide you with a test copy that you would be able to write on if you ask them for this in advance though the DRS). When reading exam questions, underline key information. Cross out answers you know to be wrong, so that they do not confuse you later on. Write out your thoughts in the margins to help you work through the questions to arrive at the right answers (especially for multiple-multiple choice exams). If you used mnemonics or other memory aids to study, write them out on the back of the test so you can reference them when needed.•	If you are feeling particularly stuck on any one question, make a mark next to it and move on to the next question. Come back to any skipped items once you have finished the rest of the test, you may find that the answer comes to you more clearly once you have had time to think about other related concepts or ideas.  •	Never leave a question blank, always take a guess (unless you are penalized for wrong answers, like on the SAT). If it is a multiple-choice exam, narrow it down to 2 or 3 choices if you can and take your best guess. If it is a short answer or essay question and you do not think you know the answer to that particular question, write whatever it is that you do know about that topic. Partial credit is better than no credit, and your teacher will know that you tried.•	When you get your tests back, ask to go over questions you got wrong with your teacher after class. Do not use this opportunity as an attempt to squabble over points, but rather use it as an opportunity to try to learn the information you did not understand. This is particularly important in science classes, as topics and concepts tend to build upon each other, and mastery of earlier information is crucial to understanding ideas that are more advanced.Based upon the results of this evaluation, XXX would benefit from the following accommodations on College Board examinations (i.e. MCAT, GRE exams): •	Timing/Scheduling: extended time, frequent breaks as needed•	Setting: small group setting, preferential seating to reduce distractions•	Responding: computerAdditional information and instructions for completing the Student Eligibility Form may be found at: http://www.collegeboard.com
