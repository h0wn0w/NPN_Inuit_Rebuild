<p>Thank you for considering a donation to Neuropsych Now. This site is a means to help enhance the practice of neuropsychology, and we hope that it continues to grow over time. If you like what you see, and/or have found value in any of our content and resources, please let us know by making a micro-donation of 9 cents to Neuropsych Now. That&#8217;s just 9 pennies, but that amount keeps us running for a day (on average). </p>

<p>Small donations will help to ensure the future of this site. We presently pay for these costs ourselves, and will continue to do so as long as there is a demand. Please know that 100% of each donation is used to offset our operating costs, which are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Site hosting bandwidth at <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech.Net</a> - this is where the Neuropsych Now Web site is hosted.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon web services</a> bandwidth - we use Amazon web services as our Content Distribution Network (or CDN) to efficiently serve up media of all types (e.g., images, video).</li>
</ol>

<p>No matter what, we sincerely thank everyone for their ongoing support of Neuropsych Now!</p>
